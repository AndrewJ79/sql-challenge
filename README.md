Employee Database Project

Description

This project involves designing, implementing, and analyzing an Employee Database using PostgreSQL. It demonstrates data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis skills by building and querying a database for employee management. The database includes information on employees, their departments, titles, salaries, and managerial assignments.

Project Structure
The project is divided into the following components:

Data Modeling:

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to define the relationships between tables in the database.
The schema includes six tables: departments, employees, titles, dept_emp, dept_manager, and salaries.
Data Engineering:

SQL scripts for creating tables, defining data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Data imported into the tables using CSV files provided.
Data Analysis:

SQL queries to analyze the data, such as retrieving employee details, department information, and aggregated results.
